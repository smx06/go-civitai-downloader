Introduction

This article describes how to use the Civitai REST API. We are going to be describing the HTTP method, path, and parameters for every operation. The API will return the response status code, response headers, and a response body.

    This is still in active development and will be updated once more endpoints are made available for the public

Civitai API v1

    Authorization

Creators

    GET /api/v1/creators

Images

    GET /api/v1/images

Models

    GET /api/v1/models

Model

    GET /api/v1/models/:modelId

Model Version

    GET /api/v1/model-versions/:modelVersionId
    GET /api/v1/model-versions/by-hash/:hash

Tags

    GET /api/v1/tags

Authorization

To make authorized requests as a user you must use an API Key. You can generate an API Key from your User Account Settings.

Once you have an API Key you can authenticate with either an Authorization Header or Query String.

Creators can require that people be logged in to download their resources. That is an option we provide but not something we require – it's entirely up to the resource owner.

Please see the Guide to Downloading via API for more details and open an issue if you are still having trouble downloading.
Authorization Header

You can pass the API token as a Bearer token using the Authorization header:

GET https://civitai.com/api/v1/models
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer {api_key}

Query String

You can pass the API token as a query parameter using the ?token= parameter:

GET https://civitai.com/api/v1/models?token={api_key}
Content-Type: application/json

This method may be easier in some notebooks and scripts.
GET /api/v1/creators
Endpoint URL

https://civitai.com/api/v1/creators
Query Parameters

Notes:

    On July 2, 2023 we switch from a paging system to a cursor based system due to the volume of data and requests for this endpoint.
    Whether you use paging or cursors, you can use metadata.nextPage to get the next page of results
